The solution often involves adjusting z-index or pointer-events. The following CSS code fixes the issue by either ensuring the :hover element is on top (high z-index) or that the overlapping element allows events to pass through:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
  position: relative; /* Ensure proper positioning */
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.container > div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  /* Solution 1: Adjust z-index to ensure container is on top */
  z-index: -1; 
  /* Solution 2: Allow events to pass through */
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

This ensures that the hover effect is correctly applied to the .container element.
