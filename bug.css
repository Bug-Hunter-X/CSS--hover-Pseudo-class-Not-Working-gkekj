The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not working as anticipated.

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen; 
}
```

The hover effect should change the background color to light green when the mouse is over the `.container` element, but it doesn't work in this case. This may happen if the element has another element on top that intercepts mouse events.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></div>
</div>
```
